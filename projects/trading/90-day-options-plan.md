# 90-Day Options Plan (Structured)

> Educational framework, not personal investment advice.

## Phase 1 (Days 1-21): Foundations + Risk Engine
- Learn Greeks deeply: Delta/Gamma/Theta/Vega
- Learn IV Rank / IV Percentile and earnings impact
- Define fixed risk rules:
  - Max risk per trade: 0.5%–1.0% of account
  - Max total open risk: 4%–6%
  - No averaging down on losers
- Run only paper/backtest trades for 2 weeks

## Phase 2 (Days 22-50): One-Underlying Focus (NVDA)
- Use only 2–3 strategies:
  1. Covered Call (if shares held)
  2. Cash-Secured Put (for disciplined accumulation)
  3. Protective Put/Collar (for drawdown protection)
- Weekly review:
  - Win rate
  - Avg win / avg loss
  - Realized vs expected move
  - Rule violations count

## Phase 3 (Days 51-90): Process Scaling
- Keep same risk size; improve execution quality
- Add pre-trade checklist score (0-10)
- Add post-trade attribution: thesis / timing / volatility / execution
- Target consistency, not max return

## Hard Rules
1. No trade without a written exit plan (profit/stop/time)
2. No position size changes after entry due to emotion
3. Avoid high-gamma event exposure without defined hedge
4. Preserve capital first; compounding comes later
