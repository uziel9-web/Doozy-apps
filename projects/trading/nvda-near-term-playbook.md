> Educational framework, not personal investment advice.

## Objective
Keep upside participation while controlling drawdown and avoiding oversized event risk.

## Step 1 — Classify Regime (daily, 2 minutes)
- Trend: Above/Below 20DMA and 50DMA
- Volatility: IV Rank low (<25), medium (25-50), high (>50)
- Event risk: earnings/FOMC/CPI this week?

## Step 2 — Choose One of 3 Setups

### A) You hold shares and want income (neutral-to-bullish)
**Covered Call (7-21 DTE)**
- Sell call around ~0.20-0.30 delta
- Prefer entries when IV is medium/high
- Management:
  - Take 50-70% of max premium early
  - Roll if tested and thesis still bullish

### B) You want to add shares cheaper (bullish, patient)
**Cash-Secured Put (14-30 DTE)**
- Sell put where you'd be happy to own shares
- Typical short put delta: ~0.20-0.30
- Management:
  - Take profit at ~50%
  - If assigned, convert to covered-call cycle

### C) You are long shares but want downside protection
**Protective Put or Collar (14-45 DTE)**
- Buy put (costly but clean hedge)
- For cheaper hedge: collar (buy put + sell OTM call)
- Use around macro/earnings uncertainty windows

## Step 3 — Risk Limits (non-negotiable)
- Max risk per new options trade: 0.5%-1.0% account
- Max aggregate open risk: 4%-6%
- No adding to losers to "fix" entry
- If rule breaks -> stop trading for 24h and review journal

## Step 4 — Weekly Rhythm
- Sunday: define levels and scenarios (bull/base/bear)
- Daily open: regime check + only A/B/C setup selection
- Friday: close/roll review + journal stats

## Fast Decision Tree
1. Holding shares?
   - Yes -> want income? **A**
   - Yes -> worried about drawdown? **C**
2. Not adding now but willing to buy lower? **B**
3. Big event in 24-72h and no edge? Reduce size / wait.
